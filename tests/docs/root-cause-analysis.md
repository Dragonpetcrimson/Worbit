  "conclusion": "The Orbit Analyzer test system has evolved beyond its current documentation. To maintain the system's usability and prevent future issues, the Test-AI2AI.json documentation should be updated to accurately reflect the current implementation, with special attention to path handling, utility functions, and robustness features. These updates will ensure developers can fully leverage the system's capabilities and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nKey updates made to Test-AI2AI.json include:\n1. Addition of the missing get_test_by_name method in TestRegistry\n2. Documentation of path sanitization functions like sanitize_base_directory and cleanup_nested_directories\n3. Addition of utility functions like timeit, has_required_module, and copy_test_files\n4. Documentation of component preservation verification utilities\n5. Documentation of directory structure fixing functionality\n6. Enhancement of the visualization system documentation with feature flag information\n7. Addition of new test classes from structure_tests.py that weren't previously documented"
